 <h1>Movie recommendations according to Don</h1>
 <h2>Here are my favorite 3 movies of all time</h2>
 <hr />
 <h3>As Good As it Gets</h3>
 <p>This is a classic, it touches so many issues and kinds of people and how they all blend in this mad city of New York!</p>
 <h3>Jerry Maguire</h3>
 <p>'Nuff said! Life, love & work, must see</p>
 <h3>Pulp Fiction</h3>
 <p>It's touch to pick one from the Q, but if one <b>HAD</b> to then this would be it</p>
